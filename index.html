            <h2 class="secheading">Adventure Time</h2>
            <p class="text">Adventure is a thrilling experience which increases the excitement and the rush of adrenaline in the blood. It also refers to an activity that is exciting, exhilarating and having some element of risk.</p> 
            <p class="text"> Mountain bike riding, Para gliding, swimming, parachute jumping, and dirt racing are some of the examples of adventurous activities. Adventure is often pursued for psychological improvement and also to gain knowledge and experiences as in case of exploration and jungle safaris. Adventure involves risk yet people long for it because of the boost it gives to oneâ€™s confidence and mood. It is surely good to be adventurous unless it is done after carefully analyzing the risk involved.</p>

                <h2 class="desc">BIKING</h2>
            </div>
            <p class="text">Mountain biking is a sport of riding bicycles off-road, often over rough terrain, usually using specially designed mountain bikes. Mountain bikes share similarities with other bikes but incorporate features designed to enhance durability and performance in rough terrain, such as air or coil-sprung shocks used as suspension, larger and wider wheels and tires, stronger frame materials, and mechanically or hydraulically actuated disc brakes. Mountain biking can generally be broken down into five distinct categories: cross country, trail riding, all mountain (also referred to as "Enduro"), downhill, and freeride.</p>
            <p class="text">This sport requires endurance, core and back strength, balance, bike handling skills, and self-reliance. Advanced riders pursue both steep technical descents and high-incline climbs. In the case of freeride, downhill, and dirt jumping, aerial maneuvers are performed off both natural features and specially constructed jumps and ramps.</p>

                <h2 class="desc">PARAGLIDING</h2>
            </div>
            <p class="text">Paragliding is the recreational and competitive adventure sport of flying paragliders: lightweight, free-flying, foot-launched glider aircraft with no rigid primary structure.[1] The pilot sits in a harness or lies prone in a cocoon-like 'pod' suspended below a fabric wing. Wing shape is maintained by the suspension lines, the pressure of air entering vents in the front of the wing, and the aerodynamic forces of the air flowing over the outside.</p> 
            <p class="text">  Despite not using an engine, paraglider flights can last many hours and cover many hundreds of kilometres, though flights of one to five hours and covering some tens of kilometres are more the norm. By skillful exploitation of sources of lift, the pilot may gain height, often climbing to altitudes of a few thousand metres.</p>

                <h2 class="desc">SURFING</h2>
            </div>
            <p class="text">Surfing is a water sport done in the ocean or sea. The surfer uses their surfboard to catch a wave and ride in towards the shore.</p> 
            <p class="text">Surfing was invented by the Polynesians at least 4000 years ago. Surfing made its Olympic debut at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, Japan. It has become a popular sport among both men and women of all ages. With lifestyles and regimens freer than those of most sports, surfers comprise a unique culture. Though surfing is practiced in many other Pacific nations, its center remains Hawaii, where many rounds of the international surfing championships (the ASP) are held annually. Surfing is popular in Australia, the US, and Northern Europe.</p>
